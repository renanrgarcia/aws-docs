# SSH

- SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote servers.
- It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using encryption.
- Commonly used for managing Linux servers and executing commands remotely.
- SSH keys can be used for authentication instead of passwords, providing an extra layer of security.
- The default port for SSH is 22.

## Summary Table

- SSH - Linux, Mac, Windows 10+
- Putty - Windows
- EC2 Instance Connect - All

## SSH to EC2

- Ensure your security group allows inbound SSH traffic (port 22).
- Use an SSH client to connect to your instance:
  - Linux/Mac/Windows 10+: `ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-dns`
  - Windows: Use Putty (Windows 10-) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- Only the user must have read access to the private key file.
  - On Linux/Mac: `chmod 400 /path/to/key.pem`
  - On Windows: Right-click the file > Properties > Security > Edit > Add your user > Allow Read.

## Alternative: EC2 Instance Connect

- EC2 Instance Connect provides a way to securely connect to your instances without needing to manage SSH keys.
- It uses temporary SSH keys that are generated and deployed to the instance at the time of connection.
- This method is particularly useful for instances that are not accessible via traditional SSH methods.
- It needs the port 22 to be open in the security group.
