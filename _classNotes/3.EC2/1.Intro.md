# EC2 Intro

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- EC2 allows you to run virtual servers (instances) on-demand, providing flexibility and scalability.
- Key features of EC2:
  - Renting virtual servers (instances) with various configurations (EC2).
  - Storing data using Amazon S3 or EBS.
  - Distributing traffic using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).
  - Scaling resources automatically with Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

## Configuration Options

- Choose OS (Windows, Linux, etc.).
- Select instance type (CPU, memory, storage).
- How much storage:
  - Network-attached storage (EBS & EFS).
  - Hard disk storage (EC2 Instance Store).
- Network Card (speed, bandwidth, Public IP, etc.).
- Security groups (firewall rules).
- Bootstrap scripts to configure at first launch (EC2 user data).

## EC2 User Data

- User data allows you to run scripts or commands when an instance launches.
- Common use cases:
  - Install software packages and updates.
  - Configure system settings.
  - Start services or applications.
- It runs as the root user on Linux instances and as an administrator on Windows instances.

## Instance types

- EC2 instances come in various types optimized for different use cases:
  - General Purpose (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large): Balanced CPU, memory, and networking.
  - Compute Optimized (e.g., c5.large): High CPU performance for compute-intensive tasks.
  - Memory Optimized (e.g., r5.large): High memory capacity for memory-intensive applications.
  - Storage Optimized (e.g., i3.large): High I/O performance for storage-intensive workloads.
  - GPU Instances (e.g., p3.2xlarge): For machine learning and graphics-intensive applications.
- t2.micro is eligible for the AWS Free Tier up to 750 hours per month for the first 12 months.
