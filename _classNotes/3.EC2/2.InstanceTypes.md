# EC2 Instance Types

- EC2 instance types are categorized based on their hardware specifications and intended use cases.
- Each instance type provides different combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ - official documentation for detailed specifications.
- instances.vantage.sh - a third-party site for comparing instance types.

## Instance Type Name Conventions

- Instance type names follow a specific convention: `<family>.<size>`
  - Family: Indicates the instance family (e.g., t2, m5, c5, r5).
    - t: instance class
    - 2: generation (AWS releases new generations periodically)
  - Size: Indicates the size of the instance within the family (e.g., micro, small, medium, large, xlarge).
    - The size determines the amount of CPU, memory, and other resources allocated to the instance.

## General Purpose Instances

- Balanced CPU, memory, and networking resources.
- Suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers, development environments, and small databases.
- Examples: t2.micro (free tier eligible), m5.large.

## Compute Optimized Instances

- High CPU performance for compute-intensive tasks.
- Ideal for applications that require significant processing power, such as high-performance web servers, batch processing, dedicated gaming servers, and scientific modeling & machine learning.
- Examples: c5.large, c5.xlarge.

## Memory Optimized Instances

- High memory capacity for memory-intensive applications.
- Suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases, real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing (HPC).
- Examples: r5.large, r5.xlarge.

## Storage Optimized Instances

- High I/O performance for storage-intensive workloads.
- Ideal for applications that require high disk throughput and low latency, such as NoSQL databases, data warehousing, caching, and big data analytics.
- Examples: i3.large, i3.xlarge.
