# TTL - Route 53

- TTL (Time to Live) is a setting for DNS records that specifies the duration (in seconds) that a DNS resolver should cache the record before querying the authoritative DNS server again.
- Use cases:
  - Short TTL (e.g., 60 seconds):
    - Useful for records that may change frequently, such as load balancer IP addresses or failover configurations.
    - Allows for quicker propagation of changes, but increases the number of DNS queries to the authoritative server.
    - Potentially higher costs due to increased DNS queries.
  - Long TTL (e.g., 86400 seconds or 24 hours):
    - Suitable for records that rarely change, such as static website IP addresses.
    - Possibly outdated records.
    - Reduces the number of DNS queries to the authoritative server, improving performance and reducing costs.
- Strategy:
  - Set up a longer TTL when the record is stable.
  - Temporarily reduce the TTL before making changes to the record to ensure quicker propagation.
  - After the change has propagated, revert to a longer TTL to optimize performance and cost.
