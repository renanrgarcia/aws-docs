# CNAME vs Alias

- AWS Resources (e.g., CloudFront, S3, ELB) have DNS names that can change over time. E.g.:
  - `d1234abcdef8.cloudfront.net`
  - `mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com`
  - `my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`
- CNAME:
  - Points one domain name to another domain name. (E.g., `d1234abcdef8.cloudfront.net` -> `anything.mydomain.com`)
  - Only for non-root domains (e.g., `www.mydomain.com`, not `mydomain.com`).
- Alias:
  - AWS-specific extension to DNS.
  - Can point to AWS resources. Eg: `mydistribution.cloudfront.net` -> `anything.mydomain.com`
  - Can be used for root domains (e.g., `mydomain.com`). Also called "zone apex".
  - No additional cost for DNS queries to Alias records.
  - Native health checking and failover support.
  - Automatically updated when the AWS resource changes (e.g., ELB IP addresses).
  - Is always of type A or AAAA (IPv4 or IPv6).

## Alias Record Supported Resources

- ELB load balancers
- CloudFront distributions
- API Gateway
- S3 Website endpoints
- Elastic Beanstalk environments
- VPC endpoints
- Global Accelerator accelerators
- Route 53 Resolver endpoints in the same hosted zone

- You cannot set an Alias record for an EC2 DNS name.
