# DNS

- DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1).
- It's the backbone of the internet.
- Uses a hierarchical structure with different levels of domains (TLDs, second-level domains, subdomains).
  - E.g., in www.example.com:
    - .com is the TLD (Top-Level Domain)
    - example is the second-level domain
    - www is a subdomain

## Terminology

- Domain Registrar: Company that manages the reservation of domain names (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Amazon Route 53).
- DNS Records: Instructions that tell the DNS how to handle requests for a domain (e.g., A record, AAAA record, CNAME, MX record).
- Zone File: A file that contains DNS records for a domain.
- Name Server: Resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or Non-Authoritative).
  - Authoritative Name Server: Provides answers to queries about domains it is responsible for.
  - Non-Authoritative Name Server: Caches DNS query results from authoritative servers to speed up future requests.
- TLD (Top-Level Domain): The last segment of a domain name (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
- SLD (Second-Level Domain): The part of the domain name directly to the left of the TLD (e.g., example in example.com).
- Local DNS Server: A DNS server that is typically provided by an ISP or organization to resolve domain names for its users.
- Subdomain: A domain that is part of a larger domain (e.g., blog.example.com).
- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): The complete domain name for a specific host, including all higher-level domains (e.g., www.blog.example.com).
- Protocol: A set of rules for transmitting data over a network (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).
- URL (Uniform Resource Locator): The address of a resource on the internet, including the protocol, domain name, and path (e.g., https://www.example.com/path/to/resource).
- URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): A string of characters used to identify a resource (e.g., a URL is a type of URI).
- Root: The top of the DNS hierarchy, represented by a dot (.) and managed by root name servers.

## Domain server hierarchy

- Root > TLD > SLD > Subdomain > Local DNS Server
