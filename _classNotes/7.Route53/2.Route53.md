# Route 53

- Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
- It is fully managed and Authoritative DNS service.
  - Authoritative DNS: provides answers to queries about domains it is responsible for.
    - The customer can manage the DNS records for their domain.
- Route 53 is also a domain registrar (register and manage domain names).
- Also provides health checking and DNS failover capabilities.
- The only AWS service which provides 100% SLA (Service Level Agreement).
  - Service Level Agreement (SLA): A commitment between a service provider and a customer regarding the expected level of service.
- Why 53?
  - DNS operates over port 53 using UDP and TCP protocols.

## Records

- DNS records are instructions that tell the DNS how to handle route traffic for a domain.
- Each record contains:
  - Name: The domain or subdomain the record applies to (e.g., example.com, www.example.com).
  - Type: The type of DNS record (e.g., A, AAAA, CNAME, MX).
  - Value: The data associated with the record (e.g., IP address for A record, domain name for CNAME).
  - Routing Policy: The method used to route traffic (e.g., Simple, Weighted, Latency-based).
  - TTL (Time to Live): The duration in seconds that the record is cached by DNS resolvers.
- Route 53 supports various types of DNS records:
  - Must know types:
    - A (Address): Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
    - AAAA: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
    - CNAME (Canonical Name): Maps a domain name to another domain name (alias).
      - The target is a domain name which must resolve to an IP address (A or AAAA).
      - Cannot be used for top node of a DNS namespace (zone apex). E.g., cannot create a CNAME for example.com, but can create for www.example.com.
    - NS (Name Server): Specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain. Name servers for the Hosted Zone.
      - Control how traffic is routed for the domain and its subdomains.
  - Advanced types:
    - MX (Mail Exchange)
    - TXT (Text)
    - SRV (Service)
    - PTR (Pointer)
    - SOA (Start of Authority)
    - SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
    - CAA (Certification Authority Authorization)
    - DS (Delegation Signer)

## Hosted Zones

- A hosted zone is a container for DNS records for a specific domain and its subdomains.
- Public Hosted Zone: Used to manage DNS records for a domain that is accessible over the internet (public domain names).
  - E.g., publicdomain.com, www.publicdomain.com
- Private Hosted Zone: Used to manage DNS records for a domain within one or more Amazon VPCs (private domain names).
  - E.g., internal.mycompany.com, db.internal.mycompany.com
