# Domain Registrar vs DNS Service

- You buy or register a domain name from a domain registrar. Tipically, you pay an annual fee to maintain ownership of the domain (e.g., GoDaddy, NameCheap, Google Domains, AWS Route 53, Amazon Registrar Inc.).
- The domain registrar usually provides DNS service to manage the DNS records for the domain.
- But you can use a different DNS service (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Route 53).
  - Example: You register the domain with GoDaddy but use Route 53 as the DNS service.

## Using GoDaddy as Domain Registrar and Route 53 as DNS Service

1. On Amazon Route 53:
   - Create a public hosted zone for the domain (e.g., example.com).
   - Note the 4 NS (name server) records created by Route 53 for the hosted zone. (E.g., ns-123.awsdns-45.com, ns-678.awsdns-90.org, etc.)
2. On GoDaddy:
   - Update the domain's name servers to the 4 NS records provided by Route 53.

## 3rd Party Domain Registrar + Route 53 as DNS Service

- You can use Route 53 as the DNS service for domains registered with 3rd party domain registrars.

1. Create a public hosted zone in Route 53 for the domain.
2. Update the domain's name servers at the domain registrar to the 4 NS records provided by Route 53.
