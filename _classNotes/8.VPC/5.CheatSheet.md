# Cheat Sheet

- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud
- **Subnets**: Tied to Availability Zones (AZs), can be public or private. Network partition within a VPC.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: Allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. Required for public subnets.
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
- **NAT Instance**: A NAT device implemented as an EC2 instance. Less scalable and less available than a NAT Gateway.
- **NACL**: Network Access Control List, a stateless firewall at the subnet level. Evaluates all rules before allowing traffic.
- **Security Group**: A stateful firewall at the instance level or network interface level (ENI). Evaluates all rules before allowing traffic.
- **ENI**: Elastic Network Interface, a virtual network interface that can be attached to an instance in a VPC.
- **VPC Peering**: Connects two VPCs to route traffic between them using private IP addresses. Non-transitive relationship.
- **VPC Endpoint**: Enables private connections between your VPC and supported AWS services without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Two types: Interface Endpoint and Gateway Endpoint.
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects your on-premises network to your AWS VPC over an IPsec VPN tunnel. Used for hybrid cloud architectures.
- **AWS Direct Connect (DX)**: A dedicated physical network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. Provides a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.
