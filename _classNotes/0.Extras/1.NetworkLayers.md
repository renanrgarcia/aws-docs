# Network Layers

## OSI Model

- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model: Conceptual framework used to understand and implement networking protocols in seven layers.
- Layers:

  1. **Physical Layer**: Responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium such as cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals. It defines hardware specifications, voltage levels, and timing.

  - **Protocols/Technologies**: Ethernet (physical signaling), USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (physical radio transmission).

  2. **Data Link Layer**: Ensures reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer. Handles error detection/correction and flow control.

  - **Protocols**: Ethernet (MAC), PPP, Wi-Fi (802.11 MAC), ARP.

  3. **Network Layer**: Manages logical addressing and routing of packets across multiple networks. Determines the best path for data delivery.

  - **Protocols**: IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, IPsec, OSPF, BGP.

  4. **Transport Layer**: Provides end-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control between hosts. Segments and reassembles data.

  - **Protocols**: TCP (reliable, connection-oriented), UDP (unreliable, connectionless), SCTP.

  5. **Session Layer**: Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications. Coordinates dialog control and synchronization.

  - **Protocols/Concepts**: NetBIOS, RPC, session establishment in TLS/SSL.

  6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates, encrypts, and compresses data for the application layer. Ensures data is in a usable format.

  - **Protocols/Concepts**: SSL/TLS (encryption), JPEG, GIF, MPEG (data encoding), ASCII, EBCDIC.

  7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services directly to end-user applications. Defines protocols for data exchange and resource sharing.

  - **Protocols**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, POP3, IMAP, SNMP.
