# IP Management

- **Static IP**: An IP address that does not change over time. In AWS, Elastic IPs are static public IPs.
- **Dynamic IP**: An IP address that can change over time. In AWS, public IPs assigned to instances are dynamic and can change when the instance is stopped and started.
- **Public IP**: A dynamic IP address assigned to an instance from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses. It is released when the instance is stopped or terminated.
  - Suitable for instances that do not require a fixed IP address.
- **Private IP**: An IP address assigned to an instance within a VPC. It is used for communication between instances in the same VPC and is not routable over the internet.
  - Each instance in a VPC is assigned a primary private IP address, and you can also assign additional secondary private IP addresses.
- **Elastic IP (EIP)**: A static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It is associated with your AWS account and can be allocated to any instance in your account.
  - Useful for instances that need a fixed public IP address, such as web servers or bastion hosts.
  - You can remap an EIP to another instance in case of failure.
  - Note: There is a small hourly charge for EIPs that are not associated with a running instance.

## IP Tables

- Consists of tables, chains, and rules:
  - Tables: Different types of tables for different purposes (e.g., `filter`, `nat`, `mangle`).
  - Chains: Predefined chains (e.g., `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, `FORWARD`) where rules are applied.
  - Rules: Specific conditions and actions for handling packets (e.g., accept, drop, log).
- Used for configuring network packet filtering and NAT on Linux systems.
- Common commands:
  - `iptables -L`: List all rules in the filter table.
  - `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT`: Allow incoming SSH traffic.
  - `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`: Allow incoming HTTP traffic.
  - `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT`: Allow incoming HTTPS traffic.
  - `iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT`: Allow established and related connections.
  - `iptables -P INPUT DROP`: Set default policy to drop all incoming traffic not explicitly allowed.
