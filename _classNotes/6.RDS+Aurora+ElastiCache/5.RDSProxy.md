## Lambda + RDS Proxy

- RDS Proxy is ideal for serverless applications using AWS Lambda that require a relational database.
- Lambda functions can open many database connections, which can overwhelm the database.
- RDS Proxy helps manage and pool these connections, improving performance and reducing the risk of connection exhaustion.
