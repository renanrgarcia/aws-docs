# RDS and Aurora Security

- `At-rest encryption` (data stored on disk)
  - RDS supports encryption at rest using AWS KMS (Key Management Service).
  - You must enable encryption when creating a new RDS/Aurora instance.
  - To encrypt an existing unencrypted RDS/Aurora instance, you need to create a snapshot, copy it with encryption enabled, and restore a new instance from the encrypted snapshot.
- `Read replicas and Multi-AZ`
  - Both support encryption at rest.
  - Read replicas inherit the encryption settings of the source DB instance.
  - Multi-AZ deployments ensure that both primary and standby instances are encrypted if the primary is encrypted.
- `In-flight encryption` (data in transit from your application to the RDS/Aurora instance)
  - RDS supports SSL/TLS for encrypting data in transit between your application and the RDS/Aurora instance.
  - Uses AWS TLS root CA certificates client-side.
- `IAM Database Authentication` (Only for MySQL and PostgreSQL)
  - Allows you to use IAM roles and policies to manage database access instead of traditional username/password.
- `Security Groups`
  - Control network access to your RDS/Aurora instances.
- `No SSH access`
  - You cannot SSH into RDS/Aurora instances; except on RDS Custom.
- `Audit logs`
  - RDS/Aurora can integrate with AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail for logging and monitoring database activities.
