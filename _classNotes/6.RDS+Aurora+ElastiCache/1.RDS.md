# RDS Intro

- RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed relational database service provided by AWS.
- It supports multiple database engines, including:
  - Amazon Aurora (a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud)
  - PostgreSQL
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle Database
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - IBM Db2

## Why RDS versus self-managed database on EC2?

- RDS is a managed service:
  - Automated provisioning and OS patching
  - Continuous backups and point-in-time recovery (PITR)
  - Monitoring dashboards and metrics via CloudWatch
  - Read replicas for improved read performance
  - Multi-AZ deployments for high availability and failover support (DR - Disaster Recovery)
  - Maintenance windows for updates
  - Scalability: easy to scale horizontally (read replicas) and vertically (instance size)
  - Storage backed on EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- BUT we can't SSH into the RDS instance (no OS access)

## RDS - Storage Auto Scaling

- Helps to increase storage capacity automatically when needed
- Ensures that the database can handle growth in data volume
- You have to set a maximum storage threshold to avoid unexpected costs
- Automatically modify storage if:
  - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  - 6 hours have passed since the last storage modification
