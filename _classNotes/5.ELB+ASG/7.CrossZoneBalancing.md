# Cross Zone Load Balancing

- Concept: A feature that allows a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly across all registered instances in all enabled Availability Zones (AZs), regardless of the AZ from which the request originated.
  - Without cross-zone load balancing, the load is distributed only among the nodes in the same AZ as the incoming request. It can lead to uneven load distribution between AZs and the number of instances in each AZ.
- Helps improve fault tolerance and availability by ensuring that traffic is balanced across all instances, even if some AZs are experiencing higher load or failures.
