# Scalability & High Availability

- Scalability: The ability to increase resources to handle increased load.
  - Vertical Scaling [Scale Up/Down]: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. But there's a limit to how much you can scale vertically.
  - Horizontal Scaling (Elasticity) [Scale Out/In]: Adding more machines to distribute the load. It implies that we have a distributed system.
- On AWS, vertical scaling can be done by changing the instance type of an EC2 instance. Other services like RDS and ElastiCache also support vertical scaling.
- On AWS, horizontal scaling is often achieved using Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB). Also, services like DynamoDB and S3 are designed to scale horizontally automatically.

- High Availability: The ability to remain operational and accessible even in the event of failures.
  - Achieved through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and distributing resources across multiple locations (like Availability Zones == Data Centers).
  - Can also be passive, like RDS Multi-AZ deployments, where a standby instance is maintained in another AZ and automatically promoted in case of failure.
  - On AWS, we have autoscaling groups that can span multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. ELBs also distribute traffic across multiple instances in different AZs.
