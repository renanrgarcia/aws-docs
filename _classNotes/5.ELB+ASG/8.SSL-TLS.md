# SSL/TLS Certificates

- **SSL Certificate** allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption).
- `SSL` (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor to `TLS` (Transport Layer Security). TLS is more secure and efficient than SSL. However, the term "SSL" is still commonly used to refer to both SSL and TLS protocols.
