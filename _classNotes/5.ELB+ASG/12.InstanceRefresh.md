# Instance Refresh

- Instance Refresh is a feature of Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) that allows you to update instances in the group with minimal disruption.
  - In practice, after updating the launch template or configuration, you can initiate an instance refresh to replace existing instances with new ones based on the updated configuration.
- We need to set the minimum healthy percentage (e.g., 60%) to ensure that a certain number of instances remain healthy and available during the refresh process.
- Also we can set the instance warm-up time (e.g., 300 seconds) to allow new instances to stabilize before they are considered healthy.
