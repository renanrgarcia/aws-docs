# NLB

- Network Load Balancer (NLB) (v2 - new generation 2016): Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4)
- Load balancing to multiple TCP/UDP applications across machines (target groups).
- Handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.
- Has ultra-low latency.
- Has one static IP per Availability Zone and supports Elastic IPs (helpful for whitelisting specific IPs).

## Target Groups

- Types of target groups:
  - `EC2 Instances`: Routes traffic to EC2 instances using their instance ID.
    - Can be managed by an Auto Scaling group - TCP/UDP
  - `IP addresses`: Routes traffic to IP addresses.
    - Can be used for on-premises resources or resources outside the VPC - TCP/UDP
    - Must be private IPs within the VPC CIDR range.
  - `Application Load Balancers`: Routes traffic to ALBs using their ARN.
    - Can be used for advanced routing features of ALB - TCP/UDP
    - This way, we can use NLB for static IP and ALB for advanced routing.
- Health checks are performed on each target in the group to determine its availability.
  - Supports TCP, HTTP, HTTPS health checks.

## Security Groups

- Equal to ALB, NLB uses security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to the load balancer.
