# AWS Intro

- `https://infrastructure.aws/`: it shows the AWS infrastructure in a visual way. Regions and Availability Zones.

## AWS Regions

- **Region**: A geographical area where AWS has multiple data centers. It is a cluster of data centers in a specific location.
  - Names of regions are in the format `region-code`, e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`.
  - Each region is isolated from others to provide fault tolerance and stability.
  - Most of the AWS services are region-scoped, meaning they are available in specific regions.
- How to choose a region:
  - Proximity to users: Choose a region that is geographically closer to your end-users for lower latency.
  - Compliance and data residency: Some regions may have specific compliance requirements or data residency laws.
  - Service availability: Not all AWS services are available in every region, so check the service availability in the desired region.
  - Pricing: AWS pricing may vary by region, so consider the cost implications of using a specific region.

## Availability Zones

- **Availability Zone (AZ)**: A distinct location within a region that is engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones.
- Each region has multiple Availability Zones. Usually 3, minimum 3, maximum 6.
- AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance, but they are connected through low-latency, high-throughput, and redundant networking.
  - They also have redundant power, cooling, and physical security.
- Example: `ap-southeast-1a`, `ap-southeast-1b`, `ap-southeast-1c`, inside the region `ap-southeast-1` (Asia Pacific (Singapore)).

## AWS Edge Locations (Points of Presence - PoPs)

- **Edge Location**: A site that Amazon CloudFront uses to cache copies of content for faster delivery to users. It provides low latency access to content.
- Amazon has 400+ points of presence (400+ Edge Locations and 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries.

## Example of service availability in regions

- Some services are available in all regions, while others may only be available in specific regions.
- For example, Amazon Route 53 (DNS service) is available in all regions, while Amazon Aurora (a relational database service) may not be available in every region.
- Always check the [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) to see which services are available in which regions.
