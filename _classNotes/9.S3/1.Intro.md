# S3

- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is one of the main building blocks of AWS.
- Theorically, S3 can store an unlimited amount of data.
- Many sites use S3 as their primary storage (backbone), including Netflix, Airbnb, and Dropbox.
- Many AWS services use S3 as an integration as well, including CloudFront, Lambda, and RDS.

## Use Cases

- Backup and Restore: files, databases, and applications.
- Disaster Recovery: store critical data offsite, for quick recovery.
- Data Archiving: long-term storage of infrequently accessed data.
- Hybrid Cloud Storage: integrate on-premises storage with cloud storage.
- Big Data Analytics: store and analyze large datasets.
- Application Hosting: host static websites and web applications.
- Media Hosting: store and deliver media files like images, videos, and audio.
- Data Lakes: central repository for structured and unstructured data at any scale.
- Software Delivery: store and distribute software packages and updates.
- Static Website Hosting: host static websites directly from S3.
- Content Distribution: integrate with CloudFront for global content delivery.

- Nasdaq uses S3 Glacier for 7 years of data archiving.
- Sysco runs analytics on its data and gain business insights.

## Buckets

- A bucket is a logical container ("directory") with folders for storing objects (files) in S3.
- Buckets have a unique name across all AWS accounts and regions.
- S3 looks like a global service, but buckets are created in specific regions.
- Bucket names must be globally unique, DNS-compliant, and between 3 to 63 characters long. Conventions:
  - Only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and periods (.)
  - Start and end with a letter or number
  - No consecutive periods or hyphens next to periods
  - Cannot be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
  - Must not start with "xn--" or end with "-s3alias"

## Objects

- Objects (files) have a key (name), value (data), and metadata (information about the object).
- The key is the full path:
  - Example: "s3://my-bucket/photos/2023/vacation.jpg"
  - It is composed of prefix (folder path) and object name (file name). On the example above, the prefix is "photos/2023/" and the object name is "vacation.jpg".
- There's no concept of "directories" in within buckets (although the console shows it that way).
- Just keys with very long names that include slashes (/).
- `Object values` are the content of the body:
  - Can be any type of data: text files, images, videos, documents, etc.
  - Maximum object size is 5TB.
  - Objects larger than 5GB should use multipart upload.
    - Recommended for objects larger than 100MB.
- `Metadata` is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object:
  - System-defined metadata: predefined by S3 (e.g., Content-Type, Content-Length).
  - User-defined metadata: custom metadata added by users (e.g., x-amz-meta-author).
- `Tags` are key-value pairs that help organize and manage objects:
  - Can be used for cost allocation, access control, and lifecycle management.
  - Example: "Environment=Production", "Department=Finance".
- `Version ID`: unique identifier for each version of an object.

## Security

- S3 pre-signed URLs allow temporary access to private objects.
- S3 supports encryption at rest and in transit.
