# S3 Replication

- Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**
- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- Use cases:
  - CRR – compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
  - SRR – log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

## Notes

- After you enable Replication, only new objects are replicated
- Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using `S3 Batch Replication`
  - Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication
- For DELETE operations
  - Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting)
  - Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)
- There is no “chaining” of replication
  - If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3
  - Then objects created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3
