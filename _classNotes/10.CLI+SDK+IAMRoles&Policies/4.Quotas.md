# AWS Limits and Quotas

- API Rate Limits: maximum number of API calls per second
  - E.g. DescribeInstances API for EC2 has a limit of 100 calls per seconds
  - E.g. GetObject on S3 has a limit of 5500 GET per second per prefix
  - For Intermittent Errors: implement Exponential Backoff
  - For Consistent Errors: request an API throttling limit increase
- Service Quotas (Service Limits): maximum allowed resources per account per region
  - E.g. Running On-Demand Standard Instances: 1152 vCPU
  - You can request a service limit increase by opening a ticket
  - You can request a service quota increase by using the Service Quotas API

## Exponential Backoff

- If you get ThrottlingException intermittently, use exponential backoff
- Retry mechanism already included in AWS SDK API calls
- Must implement yourself if using the AWS API as-is or in specific cases
  - Must only implement the retries on 5xx server errors and throttling
  - Do not implement on the 4xx client errors
- E.g. if you get a 503 error, wait 1 second and retry
  - If it fails again, wait 2 seconds and retry
  - If it fails again, wait 4 seconds and retry
  - If it fails again, wait 8 seconds and retry
  - And so on...
