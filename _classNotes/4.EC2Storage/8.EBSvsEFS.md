# EBS vs EFS

- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances, similar to a hard drive.
  - Can only be attached to one instance at a time (multi-attach feature allows multiple instances at the associate level).
  - Bound to a specific Availability Zone (AZ) and cannot be moved across AZs without creating a snapshot.
  - Has provisioned capacity and performance (IOPS).
    - On gp2 volumes, IOPS scales with the size of the volume.
    - On gp3/io1/io2 volumes, IOPS can be provisioned independently of volume size.
  - To migrate an EBS volume to another AZ, create a snapshot and then create a new volume in the desired AZ from that snapshot.
  - EBS backups use I/O, so it's recommended to stop the instance before creating a snapshot for data integrity.
- **EFS (Elastic File System)** is a fully managed, scalable, and elastic NFS file system that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances.
  - Works with AWS services like EC2, Lambda, and ECS in multiple Availability Zones.
  - Highly available and durable, with data stored across multiple Availability Zones.
  - Only with Linux-based AMIs (POSIX file system).
  - Expensive (3x the cost of standard gp2 EBS volumes)
  - Pay-per-use pricing model based on the amount of data stored and the amount of data transferred.
  - Use cases include content management, big data analytics, and media processing workflows.
