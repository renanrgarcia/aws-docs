# Multi-attach

- Allows multiple EC2 instances to attach to the same EBS volume on the same Availability Zone.
- Supported only on io1 and io2 Block Express volumes.
- Each instance can access the volume concurrently with full read and write permissions.
- Use case:
  - Achieve high availability for applications for cluster Linux applications (Ex: Teradata)
  - Applications must manage data consistency at the application level.
- Up to 16 instances can be attached to a single volume.
- Need to use a cluster-aware file system (e.g., GFS2, OCFS2) or implement application-level locking.
  - Not XFS, EXT4, etc.
