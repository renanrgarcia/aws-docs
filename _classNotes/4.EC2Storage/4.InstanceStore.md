# EC2 Instance Store

- EBS volumes are network drives with good, but limited performance.
- If you need high I/O performance and can tolerate data loss, consider using `instance store`.
- Instance store is physically attached to the host machine and provides low-latency access to data.
  - Better I/O performance compared to EBS.
  - The caveat is that data is ephemeral and will be lost if the instance is stopped or terminated.
  - Good for: temporary storage of data that is being processed, such as cache or scratch space.
  - Risk of data loss if the instance fails or is terminated unexpectedly.
  - Backups and replication strategies are essential to mitigate data loss risks.
- Code of the Instance Store examples: `i3`, `i3en`.
