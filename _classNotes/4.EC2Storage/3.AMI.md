# AMI

- Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template for creating EC2 instances.
  - It contains the operating system, application server, and applications required to launch an instance.
  - Faster to launch an instance from an AMI than to install the OS and applications manually.
- They are region-specific, meaning an AMI created in one region cannot be used in another region without copying it.
- AMIs can be public, private, or shared with specific AWS accounts.
  - **Public AMIs**: Available to all AWS users. Provided by AWS or the community.
  - **Private AMIs**: Only accessible to the owner.
  - **Shared AMIs**: Shared with specific AWS accounts on AWS Marketplace or by the owner.

## Process

- Steps that we can make:
  1. Start an EC2 instance using the AMI and customize it as needed.
  2. Stop the instance (for data integrity).
  3. Build a new AMI from the instance. This will also create EBS snapshots of the instance's volumes.
  4. Launch instances from other AMIs as needed.
