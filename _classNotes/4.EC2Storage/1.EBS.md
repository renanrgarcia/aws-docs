# EBS Volumes

- Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a network drive that provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
  - It's like a hard drive for your EC2 instance.
  - May be some latency due to network access.
- Allows to persist data beyond the lifecycle of an instance.
- Can only be attached to one instance at a time, at the CCP (Certified Cloud Practitioner) level. Associate level: "multi-attach" feature allows attaching to multiple instances.
  - But can be more than one EBS volume attached to an instance.
  - There can be EBS volumes unattached to any instance.
- It is bound to a specific Availability Zone (AZ) and cannot be moved across AZs.
  - To move an EBS volume to another AZ, you must create a snapshot and then create a new volume in the desired AZ from that snapshot.
- Has provisioned capacity (GBs) and performance (IOPS - Input/Output Operations Per Second).
- `Delete on Termination` option allows you to specify whether the EBS volume should be deleted when the instance is terminated.
  - The root EBS volume of an instance is set to delete on termination by default.
  - Non-root EBS volumes do not have this option enabled by default.
  - This can be controlled by AWS Management Console or CLI.
  - Use case: If you want to keep the data on the EBS volume after the instance is terminated, you can disable this option.
