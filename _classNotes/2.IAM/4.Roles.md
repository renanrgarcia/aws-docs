# IAM Roles

- **IAM roles**: A set of permissions that define what actions are allowed on specific resources.
- IAM roles can be assumed by users, applications, or services to gain temporary access to specific resources.
- Types of IAM roles:
  - **Service roles**: Allow AWS services to act on your behalf.
  - **Cross-account roles**: Allow users from one AWS account to access resources in another account.
  - **Federated user roles**: Allow users from outside AWS (e.g., corporate directory) to access AWS resources.

## IAM Roles for Services

- IAM roles are used to grant permissions to AWS services so they can perform actions on your behalf.
- When you create a role, you define the permissions that the role has and the AWS services that can assume the role.
- IAM roles are commonly used for services like EC2, Lambda, CloudFormation, and ECS to access other AWS resources securely.
- Example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole"
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
