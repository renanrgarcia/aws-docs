# AWS Access means

- There are three main ways to access AWS services:
  - **AWS Management Console**: A web-based user interface for managing AWS services. It provides a graphical interface to interact with AWS resources.
  - **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A unified tool to manage AWS services from the command line. Protected by access keys, it allows you to automate tasks and manage AWS resources using scripts.
  - **AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Libraries that allow developers to interact with AWS services using programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, etc. Protected by access keys, SDKs provide a convenient way to integrate AWS services into applications.
- Access keys are generated through AWS Console. Users can create access keys for their IAM users, which consist of an access key ID and a secret access key.
  - They are secret and should be treated like passwords.

## Access Key

- **Access Key ID**: A unique identifier for the access key. It is used to identify the user or application making the request. Ex: `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`.
- **Secret Access Key**: A secret key used to sign requests to AWS services. It is used to authenticate the user or application making the request. Ex: `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`.

## AWS CLI

- **AWS CLI**: A command-line tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. It is a powerful tool for managing AWS resources and automating tasks.
- It is an open-source tool and an alternative to the AWS Management Console.
- On CLI, the permissions are determined by the IAM user associated with the access keys used to configure the CLI.
- Install the AWS CLI on your local machine or server to use it. `aws --version` to check if it is installed.
- `aws configure`: This command is used to set up your AWS CLI with your access keys and default region. It prompts you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format.
- `aws configure set aws_access_key_id ""` and `aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ""`: These commands are used to remove the stored access keys from your AWS CLI configuration.
- `aws iam list-users`: This command lists all IAM users in your AWS account.
  - `--region <region>`: Specifies the AWS region to use for the command.
  - `echo "test" > test.txt`: It can be used to test file creation in the current directory, for example. The files persist even after the terminal session ends.
  - We can also download or upload files.

### AWS CloudShell

- **AWS CloudShell**: A browser-based shell that provides a pre-configured environment with the AWS CLI and other tools. It allows you to run commands and scripts without needing to install anything on your local machine.

## AWS SDKs

- **AWS SDKs**: Software development kits that provide libraries and tools for various programming languages to interact with AWS services. They simplify the process of integrating AWS services into applications.
- It is embedded in your code, allowing you to make API calls to AWS services directly from your application.
