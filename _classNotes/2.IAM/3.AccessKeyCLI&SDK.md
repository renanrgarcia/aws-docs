# AWS Access means

- There are three main ways to access AWS services:
  - **AWS Management Console**: A web-based user interface for managing AWS services. It provides a graphical interface to interact with AWS resources.
  - **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A unified tool to manage AWS services from the command line. Protected by access keys, it allows you to automate tasks and manage AWS resources using scripts.
  - **AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Libraries that allow developers to interact with AWS services using programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, etc. Protected by access keys, SDKs provide a convenient way to integrate AWS services into applications.
- Access keys are generated through AWS Console. Users can create access keys for their IAM users, which consist of an access key ID and a secret access key.
  - They are secret and should be treated like passwords.

## Access Key

- **Access Key ID**: A unique identifier for the access key. It is used to identify the user or application making the request. Ex: `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`.
- **Secret Access Key**: A secret key used to sign requests to AWS services. It is used to authenticate the user or application making the request. Ex: `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`.

## AWS CLI

- **AWS CLI**: A command-line tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. It is a powerful tool for managing AWS resources and automating tasks.
- It is an open-source tool and an alternative to the AWS Management Console.
- Install the AWS CLI on your local machine or server to use it. `aws --version` to check if it is installed.

## AWS SDKs

- **AWS SDKs**: Software development kits that provide libraries and tools for various programming languages to interact with AWS services. They simplify the process of integrating AWS services into applications.
- It is embedded in your code, allowing you to make API calls to AWS services directly from your application.
