# IAM

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: A service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users.
- IAM enables you to manage permissions for AWS services and resources, allowing you to grant or deny access to specific actions and resources.
- Key features of IAM:
  - Centralized control of your AWS account
  - Shared access to your AWS account
  - Granular permissions
  - Identity federation
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Root user: The IAM user that is created when you first create an AWS account. It has full access to all AWS services and resources in the account. It is recommended to avoid using the root user for everyday tasks and instead create individual IAM users with specific permissions.

## IAM Users, Groups, and Roles

- **IAM User**: An entity that you create in AWS to represent a person or application that interacts with AWS. Each user has a unique set of credentials (access key ID and secret access key) for programmatic access, and a password for the AWS Management Console.
- **IAM Group**: A collection of IAM users. You can use groups to manage permissions for multiple users at once. For example, you can create a group called "Developers" and assign permissions to that group, which will apply to all users in the group.
  - The users in a group inherit the permissions assigned to the group.
  - A user can belong to multiple groups, and the permissions from all groups are aggregated.
- **IAM Role**: An IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. Roles are not associated with a specific user or group, but can be assumed by users, applications, or AWS services. This allows you to delegate access to resources without sharing long-term credentials.

## Multi-session Support

- **Multi-session Support**: IAM allows you to manage multiple sessions for users, enabling them to access AWS resources concurrently without conflicts.

## Best practices

- **Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks. Regularly review and adjust permissions as needed.
- **Use Groups**: Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users to simplify management.
- **Enable MFA**: Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive operations and privileged accounts.
- **Strong Password Policies**: Implement strong password policies to enhance security.
- **Do not use root user**: Avoid using the root user for everyday tasks. Instead, create individual IAM users with specific permissions. One physical person = one IAM user.
- **Create and use roles**: Use IAM roles to delegate access to resources without sharing long-term credentials. This is especially important for applications and services that need to access AWS resources.
- **Use access keys**: When programmatically accessing AWS services, use IAM user access keys instead of root user credentials. Rotate access keys regularly and remove unused keys (CLI/SDK).
- **Regularly review permissions**: Use tools like IAM Credentials Report and IAM Last Access to identify unused or stale access keys and permissions.
- **Never share credentials**: Do not share IAM user credentials or access keys with anyone. Use IAM roles and policies to grant permissions instead.
