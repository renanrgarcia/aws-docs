# IAM Security Tools

- **IAM Credentials Report** (Account-Level): A report that lists all IAM users in your account and their access keys, including the last time they were used.
  - It's useful for identifying unused or stale access keys.
- **IAM Last Access (Renamed from Access Advisor)** (User-Level): A tool that shows the permissions granted to a user and the last time those permissions were used.
  - It's useful for identifying permissions that are no longer needed.
